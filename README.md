# AdventOfCode

My solutions for [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Features

- Written in Go
- Standard library only
- All solutions are compiled into a single binary
- All solutions take reasonable time and memory usage ([performance record](records.txt))
- Built-in execution time measurement, though memory tracking is only supported on Linux

## Usage

Compilation is straightforward: `make` (or `go build`)

The program has built-in help message available with `-h` flag.
